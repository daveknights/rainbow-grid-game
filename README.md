# rainbow-grid-game

RnD task to make a grid based game. This one is in the style of games like https://play2048.co/ and https://www.doctorwho.tv/games/thirteen/.
Currently the squares moves one space at a time compared to other games like this that move all squares as far as they can go into empty space in the direction selected.
I have used html5 canvas with each square drawn in place rather than divs that are moved around.
